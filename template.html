	<atitle>Optimizing for the Wrong Variable</atitle>
    <p>
    It&rsquo;s a common disappointment to find an achievement unrewarding or meaningless after spending a great deal of time and effort working toward it. Usually, it means you chose the wrong goal,<small><sup><a href="#footnote2" name="note2">[2]</a></sup></small> i.e. optimized for the wrong variable. I think the fundamental cause of this is attribute substitution: instead of answering the essential question about self-knowledge, to answer a substitute that fails to get to the heart of the matter.</p>

<a href="#note1" name="footnote1">[1]</a> I think it&rsquo;s important to carefully examine the things that you think you like or bring you happiness. David Foster Wallace suggested that we think we like certain things only due to effective advertisement or some other form of dependency, which ultimately distracts us from the things that actually make us happy.

<a href="#note2" name="footnote2">[2]</a> Setting good goals generally seems to be a tricky business. Scott Adams suggests in his book <i>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</i> that a better approach is by following systems that will, in the long run, naturally move you toward success. For example: &ldquo;losing weight&rdquo; is a goal that requires a lot of willpower and can seem pretty arduous. &ldquo;Eating healthily&rdquo; is a system that is easier to settle on, and it implies a plethora of good effects &mdash; not just losing weight. &ldquo;Become a great philosopher&rdquo; is again a lofty goal that will more likely than not lead to disappointment, but &ldquo;learn about philosophy every week&rdquo; is a system. Goals are tough because until we&rsquo;ve achieved our goals, we feel as if we&rsquo;re falling short of them, and the satisfaction from the moment of victory usually doesn&rsquo;t last long. Systems, on the other hand, can continuously reward us. I agree with Adams: setting up flexible, but well-directed systems is more likely to produce long-term success than the staccato climb from goal to goal.
